## Leads

A lead paragraph or sentence introduces and guides the user into the primary content.

{{#demo}}
<p class="pe-lead">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&hellip;</p>
<p>
  &hellip;it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was
  the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season
  of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
  was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing
  before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct
  the other way&mdash;in short, the period was so far like the present period,
  that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received,
  for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

{{/demo}}

## Inline text

Use the `<abbr>`, `<ins>`, `<del>`, `<s>`, `<mark>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, and `<q>` elements to indicate contextual changes or differences within a string of text.

### `<abbr>`

The `<abbr>` element represents an abbreviation.

{{#demo}}
<p>
  Basic elements are the backbone of any
  <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document.
</p>
{{/demo}}

### `<ins>`, `<del>`

The `<ins>` and `<del>` elements represent text that has been inserted and deleted, respectively.

{{#demo}}
<p>It was the best of times, it was the <del>blurst</del><ins>worst</ins> of times&hellip;</p>
{{/demo}}

### `<s>`

The `<s>` (strikethrough) element should be used to indicate text that is no longer relevant or accurate.

{{#demo}}
<p>
  Support is provided for the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox,
  and Internet Explorer<s>, and IE versions 7 and 8</s>.
</p>
{{/demo}}

### `<mark>`

Use the `<mark>` element to highlight text.

{{#demo}}
<p>The latest report shows that <mark>profits have increased by 15%</mark> over the previous year.</p>
{{/demo}}

### `<em>`

Use the `<em>` element to emphasize a word, phrase, or other part of the text.

{{#demo}}
<p>I think carrots are ok, but I <em>love</em> beets.</p>
{{/demo}}

### `<strong>`

Use the `<strong>` element when you want to give text strong importance with respect to other text in the same context.

{{#demo}}
Use <kbd>rm -rf</kbd> to recursively remove files. <strong>Be careful when using
<code>-f</code> because it will remove files without prompting for confirmation.</strong>
{{/demo}}

<aside>
  <h1 class="pe-title">The difference between <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></h1>
  <p>The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements are similar. However, bold is a physical state that represents both the content and its presentation, while strong is a logical state that separates the content from its presentation&mdash;it indicates that, in the current context, the text is more important than the surrounding text.</p>
</aside>

### `<q>`

The `<q>` element should be used for inline quotations.

{{#demo}}
<p>
  <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Space#Catchphrases">That does not compute</q>
  is one of several of the Robot's catchphrases used in the television show <i>Lost in Space</i>.
</p>
{{/demo}}

## Code

### Inline

Use the `<code>` element for inline code examples.

{{#demo}}
The <code class="pe-code-inline">&lt;section&gt;</code> HTML element represents a section of a document.
{{/demo}}

### Block

A multi-line code block should be wrapped with `<pre></pre>` elements.

{{#demo}}
<pre class="pe-code"><code>
// This is a code example
function greet(greeting) {
  console.log(greeting);
}
greet('hello, world');
</code></pre>
{{/demo}}

### User Input

Use the `<kbd>` element to represent user input.

{{#demo}}
<p>
  To switch directories, type <kbd class="pe-kbd">cd</kbd> followed by the name of the directory.<br/>
  To edit settings, press <kbd class="pe-kbd">ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="pe-kbd">,</kbd>
</p>
